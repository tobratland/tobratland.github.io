    <h2>Fun facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have opened over 300 lifeline packages in training mode without getting a single extended light mag, my conclusion is that they dont exist at all in the lifeline packages. You have to do half the tutorial for each one...</li>
        <li>I have manualy counted about 4000 bullet points, plotted the coordinates into excel, and then coded in the values as part of the weapon. This took some time</li>
        <li>I have never been uncertain if I could make the webApp, my only uncertainty was how much time i would spend doing it</li>
        <li>My motivation for doing this is learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
    </ul>
